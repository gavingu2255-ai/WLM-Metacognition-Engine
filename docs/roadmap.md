# Roadmap — WLM‑Metacognition‑Engine  
**From MVP → reasoning‑path extraction → full metacognitive regulation**

This roadmap outlines the evolution of WLM‑Metacognition‑Engine  
from a minimal deterministic analyzer  
into a full structural metacognition system.

# Phase 1 — MVP (Current)
**Goal:** Establish a deterministic metacognition pipeline.

### Deliverables
- reasoning extractor  
- consistency engine (stub)  
- dimension tracker (stub)  
- signal engine (stub)  
- metacognition graph builder  
- CLI  
- documentation  

### Success Criteria
- deterministic metacognition graph generation  
- clean extension points  

---

# Phase 2 — Reasoning‑Path Extraction
**Goal:** Extract real reasoning steps and transitions.**

### Deliverables
- logical operator detection  
- premise/conclusion tagging  
- inference type classification  
- step‑to‑step transition graph  

### Success Criteria
- reasoning becomes structurally interpretable  
- transitions become explicit  

---

# Phase 3 — Consistency & Contradiction Detection
**Goal:** Detect invalid reasoning.**

### Deliverables
- contradiction detection  
- invalid inference detection  
- reasoning‑loop detection  
- missing‑premise detection  

### Success Criteria
- unstable reasoning becomes detectable  
- contradictions become explicit  

---

# Phase 4 — Dimension‑Aware Reasoning
**Goal:** Track reasoning across dimensions.**

### Deliverables
- spatial reasoning detection  
- temporal reasoning detection  
- causal reasoning detection  
- identity reasoning detection  
- knowledge reasoning detection  

### Success Criteria
- dimension switching becomes explicit  
- reasoning becomes grounded  

---

# Phase 5 — Metacognitive Signal Engine
**Goal:** Generate real metacognitive indicators.**

### Deliverables
- confidence estimation  
- uncertainty detection  
- contradiction alerts  
- reasoning‑depth indicators  
- missing‑information flags  

### Success Criteria
- AI becomes self‑aware of reasoning quality  

---

# Phase 6 — Full Metacognition Runtime
**Goal:** Real‑time reasoning monitoring.**

### Deliverables
- streaming metacognition  
- real‑time contradiction detection  
- real‑time dimension tracking  
- real‑time signal generation  

### Success Criteria
- <50ms metacognitive updates  
- stable reasoning under change

# Summary

WLM‑Metacognition‑Engine evolves through:

1. MVP — deterministic analysis  
2. Reasoning‑path extraction  
3. Contradiction detection  
4. Dimension‑aware reasoning  
5. Metacognitive signal generation  
6. Real‑time metacognition runtime  

This transforms WLM from **structured reasoning**  
into **self‑regulated reasoning**.
